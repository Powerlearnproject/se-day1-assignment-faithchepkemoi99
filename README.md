Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is a process of designing,developing, testing and maintaining software using programming languages,tools and methods. 
 It enables innovation through creativity,enhances user experience, boosts efficiency by reducing manual work and improving productivity in many industries. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
 The phrase "software engineering" was introduced in 1968 at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in response to the escalating "software crisis." Formal procedures and organized approaches to software development were deemed necessary by engineers.
 The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)
 Programming paradigms changed from procedural to object-oriented with the advent of languages like Python, Java, and C++.
 Object-oriented programming (OOP) enhanced the scalability, maintainability, and reusability of software.
 The Agile Revolution (2001-Present)
 Rigid models were replaced by agile approaches like Scrum and Kanban, which allowed for quicker and more flexible software development. 
 The Agile Manifesto was first presented in 2001 and placed a strong emphasis on adaptability, teamwork, and customer feedback.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Planning – Project goals are defined, feasibility tests done, risks considered, and resource requirements.
 Requirement Analysis – Collect  and document user needs to ensure the software meets expectations of users.
 Design – system architecture, user interfaces, and database structures are created based on needed requirements.
 Implementation – Developers write the actual code using programming languages and frameworks.
 Testing – Bugs are identified and fixed to ensure software functions correctly and meets quality standards.
 Deployment – software is released to the  end-users, either as a full launch or in phases.
 Maintenance – Providing updates, bug fixes, and improvements to keep the software functional and efficient.
 
 Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  The Waterfall methodology is a rigid,linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is a structured process with a heavy emphasis on documentation and planning. Once a phase is completed, 
  making changes is difficult and costly. This methodology is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements, minimal expected changes, and strict regulatory compliance, such as government systems and aircraft control software.
  Agile methodology on the other hand, is an iterative and flexible approach that emphasizes adaptability, customer collaboration, and incremental development. Instead of following a strict sequence, Agile divides the project into small cycles called sprints, where 
  development, testing, and feedback occur continuously. This approach allows teams to quickly adapt to changes, prioritize customer needs, and deliver functional software in shorter timeframes. Agile is particularly useful for projects with evolving requirements, 
  such as mobile applications, startups, or software products responding to changing market demands.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software applications based on project requirements.
  A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards by conducting rigorous testing. 
  A Project Manager oversees the entire software development process, ensuring projects are completed on time, within budget, and according to requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software tool that provides developers with a comprehensive workspace to write, edit, debug, and test code efficiently. Example is VS Code.
  A Version Control System (VCS) is essential for tracking changes in code, managing collaboration among developers, and maintaining a history of modifications. Example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Ensuring security of the software development against cyberattacks and data breaches. Developers should ensure encryption and also regularly conduct security audits.
 Working in a team with different skills is difficult and hence they should embrace agile methodology like scrum to improve collaboration.
 Keeping up with ever changing technology is hectic and hence developers should continuously learn.
 Debugging and troubleshooting code can be time consuming and frustrating but developers have automated  tools to debug and help with different tasks.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation to ensure it functions as expected. It helps to identify bugs early in development.
 Integration testing checks how different modules or components of a system work together. It ensures interactions between components and identifies issues in data flow and module interactions.
 System testing evaluates the entire software application as a whole to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements.  Validates that the complete system works under real-world conditions.
 Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.Confirms that the software meets customer needs before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 It is a process of creating and optimizing input prompts so as to guide AI models to generate accurate and quality responses. 
 It is important in enhancing  AI performance by improving efficiency and productivity.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  “Compose lyrics of a song”
  “Compose lyrics of a gospel song themed blessing of God”
